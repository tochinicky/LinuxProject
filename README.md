## 1. Sudo Command

The `Sudo` command, short for "superuser do," is a Unix and Linux command that allows authorized users to execute commands with the privileges of the superuser or another specified user, as defined by the system's sudoers configuration. In other words, it enables users to perform tasks that typically require administrative or root-level permissions without having to log in as the root user.
